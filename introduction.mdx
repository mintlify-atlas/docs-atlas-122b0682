fzf is a general-purpose command-line fuzzy finder that revolutionizes how you work with lists, files, command history, processes, and more in your terminal.

## What is fzf?

fzf is an interactive filter program for any kind of list. It implements a "fuzzy" matching algorithm, allowing you to quickly type patterns with omitted characters and still get the results you want. Think of it as an interactive version of grep, but much more powerful.

```bash
# Find and open a file
vim $(fzf)

# Kill a process interactively
ps -ef | fzf | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9

# Search command history
history | fzf
```

## How it works

fzf reads a list of items from standard input, allows you to select items interactively, and writes the selected ones to standard output. It's designed to work seamlessly with Unix pipes:

```bash
# List files and select one
find * -type f | fzf

# Browse git commits
git log --oneline | fzf

# Search through processes
ps aux | fzf
```

## Core features

### Fuzzy matching

Type partial strings and fzf will find matches even if characters are missing:

```bash
# Typing "rdme" will match "README.md"
# Typing "dcfg" will match "docker-config.yml"
find . -type f | fzf
```

### Advanced search syntax

fzf supports multiple search modes for precise filtering:

| Token | Match type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sbtrkt` | fuzzy-match | Items that match `sbtrkt` |
| `'wild` | exact-match | Items that include `wild` |
| `^music` | prefix-exact-match | Items that start with `music` |
| `.mp3$` | suffix-exact-match | Items that end with `.mp3` |
| `!fire` | inverse-exact-match | Items that do not include `fire` |

### Preview window

See file contents, command output, or any preview while you search:

```bash
# Preview file contents with bat
fzf --preview 'bat --color=always {}'

# Preview directory structure
fd --type d | fzf --preview 'tree -C {}'
```

### Multi-selection

Select multiple items using TAB and process them all:

```bash
# Select multiple files to delete
find . -type f | fzf --multi | xargs rm

# Select multiple git branches to delete
git branch | fzf --multi | xargs git branch -d
```

## Display modes

fzf offers flexible display options to fit your workflow:

### Fullscreen mode (default)

Perfect for focused searching through large lists.

### Height mode

Stay in context by showing fzf below your cursor:

```bash
fzf --height 40% --layout reverse --border
```

### Tmux popup mode

Integrate seamlessly with tmux:

```bash
# Center popup, 80% width and height
fzf --tmux 80%

# Side panel
fzf --tmux right,40%
```
