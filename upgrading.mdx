## Upgrading shell integration

If you installed fzf via package managers, shell integration might need manual updates.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check shell integration version">
    The shell integration scripts should be updated automatically with most installation methods. However, if you're experiencing issues, you may need to update manually.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Update shell configuration">
    Make sure your shell configuration uses the correct method:
    
    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Bash (~/.bashrc)
    # Modern method (fzf 0.48.0+)
    eval "$(fzf --bash)"
    ```
    
    ```bash Zsh (~/.zshrc)
    # Modern method (fzf 0.48.0+)
    source <(fzf --zsh)
    ```
    
    ```fish Fish (~/.config/fish/config.fish)
    # Modern method (fzf 0.48.0+)
    fzf --fish | source
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Reload your shell">
    Apply changes:
    
    ```bash
    # Bash
    source ~/.bashrc
    
    # Zsh
    source ~/.zshrc
    
    # Fish
    source ~/.config/fish/config.fish
    ```
    
    Or simply open a new terminal window.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  If you're using fzf older than 0.48.0, you'll need to source individual scripts from the `/shell` directory. Consider upgrading to a newer version for easier maintenance.
</Note>

## After upgrading

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify the new version">
    ```bash
    fzf --version
    ```
    
    Make sure the version number matches what you expected.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test basic functionality">
    ```bash
    # Test basic search
    ls | fzf
    
    # Test shell integration (if configured)
    # Press CTRL-R to test history search
    # Press CTRL-T to test file search
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Check configuration compatibility">
    Some releases introduce breaking changes. Review the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for your version to see if any of your customizations need updating.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

### Old version persists

If `fzf --version` shows an old version after upgrading:

```bash
# Check which fzf binary is being used
which fzf

# Check all fzf installations
which -a fzf
```

You might have multiple installations. Remove old ones or adjust your `$PATH`.

### Shell integration not working

If key bindings (CTRL-T, CTRL-R, ALT-C) stop working:

1. Make sure shell integration is properly configured
2. Reload your shell configuration
3. Check for conflicting key bindings
4. Verify fzf is in your `$PATH`

```bash
# Test if fzf is accessible
command -v fzf

# Check PATH
echo $PATH
```

### Vim plugin issues

If the Vim plugin isn't working after upgrade:

```vim
" Force reinstall the binary
:call fzf#install()

" Or update the plugin
:PlugUpdate fzf
```

## Downgrading

If you encounter issues with a new version, you can downgrade:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Homebrew">
    ```bash
    # View available versions
    brew search fzf
    
    # Install specific version
    brew uninstall fzf
    brew install fzf@0.67.0
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Git">
    ```bash
    cd ~/.fzf
    git checkout v0.67.0
    ./install
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Binary">
    Download an older binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/releases) and replace your current installation.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Warning>
  After downgrading, make sure to also downgrade or adjust shell integration scripts if they depend on newer features.
</Warning>
