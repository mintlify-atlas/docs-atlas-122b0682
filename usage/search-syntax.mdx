description: Master fzf's powerful search syntax including fuzzy matching, exact matching, and logical operators
---

fzf uses an extended search syntax that allows you to precisely control how items are matched. By default, fzf runs in "extended-search mode" where you can combine multiple search terms and use special tokens.

## Basic fuzzy matching

Without any special characters, fzf performs fuzzy matching:

```bash
sbtrkt
```

This matches items that contain the characters `s`, `b`, `t`, `r`, `k`, `t` in that order, but not necessarily consecutively. For example, it would match "Subtrakt" or "Subtle Tract".

## Search tokens

You can use special tokens to refine your search:

| Token | Match type | Description | Example |
|-------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| `sbtrkt` | fuzzy-match | Items that match `sbtrkt` | `sbtrkt` matches "Subtrakt" |
| `'wild` | exact-match (quoted) | Items that include `wild` | `'wild` matches "wildcard" |
| `'wild'` | exact-boundary-match | Items that include `wild` at word boundaries | `'wild'` matches "the wild" but not "wildcard" |
| `^music` | prefix-exact-match | Items that start with `music` | `^music` matches "music.mp3" |
| `.mp3$` | suffix-exact-match | Items that end with `.mp3` | `.mp3$` matches "song.mp3" |
| `!fire` | inverse-exact-match | Items that do not include `fire` | `!fire` excludes "fire.txt" |
| `!^music` | inverse-prefix-exact-match | Items that do not start with `music` | `!^music` excludes "music.mp3" |
| `!.mp3$` | inverse-suffix-exact-match | Items that do not end with `.mp3` | `!.mp3$` excludes "song.mp3" |

## Combining search terms

You can combine multiple search terms with spaces. All terms must match (AND logic):

```bash
^music .mp3$ sbtrkt !fire
```

This searches for items that:
- Start with "music"
- End with ".mp3"
- Contain the letters s, b, t, r, k, t in order
- Do not contain "fire"

## OR operator

A single bar character `|` acts as an OR operator:

```bash
^core go$ | rb$ | py$
```

This matches entries that start with "core" and end with either "go", "rb", or "py".

<Note>
The OR operator has higher precedence than the implicit AND between space-separated terms.
</Note>

## Exact matching mode

If you prefer exact (non-fuzzy) matching by default, use the `-e` or `--exact` option:

```bash
fzf --exact
```

In exact mode:
- Regular terms require exact substring matching
- The `'` prefix "unquotes" terms to enable fuzzy matching for that specific term

```bash
# In exact mode
music      # Requires exact substring "music"
'music     # Enables fuzzy matching for "music"
```

## Practical examples

<Accordion title="Finding source files">
  Search for JavaScript or TypeScript files in a src directory:
  
  ```bash
  find . -type f | fzf --query "^src/ .js$ | .ts$"
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Filtering log files">
  Find error lines that don't contain "warning":
  
  ```bash
  cat app.log | fzf --query "error !warning"
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Git branch selection">
  Find feature branches excluding main/master:
  
  ```bash
  git branch | fzf --query "^feature !main !master"
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Package search">
  Search for Python packages ending with "test" or "testing":
  
  ```bash
  pip list | fzf --query "test$ | testing$"
  ```
</Accordion>

## Search algorithms and schemes

fzf provides different search schemes optimized for different types of input:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Default scheme">
    ```bash
    fzf --scheme=default
    ```
    
    Generic scheme designed to work well with any kind of input.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Path scheme">
    ```bash
    fzf --scheme=path
    ```
    
    Optimized for file paths. Gives higher priority to matches in file names vs. directory names.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="History scheme">
    ```bash
    fzf --scheme=history
    ```
    
    Suitable for command history or any input where chronological ordering is important.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Smart case sensitivity

By default, fzf is case-insensitive. Use `--smart-case` to make searches case-sensitive only when the query contains uppercase letters:

```bash
fzf --smart-case
```

Examples with `--smart-case`:
- `hello` matches "Hello", "HELLO", "hello"
- `Hello` only matches "Hello" (case-sensitive)

For explicit case sensitivity:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Case-sensitive
fzf --case-sensitive
# or
fzf +i
```

```bash Case-insensitive
fzf --ignore-case
# or
fzf -i
```

</CodeGroup>

## Advanced search techniques

### Multi-field matching

Use `--delimiter` and `--nth` to search specific fields:

```bash
# Only search the filename (3rd field) in git grep output
git grep -n . | fzf --delimiter : --nth 3
```

### Regular expression delimiters

You can use regular expressions as delimiters, though simple string delimiters perform better:

```bash
# Split on any whitespace
ps -ef | fzf --delimiter '[[:space:]]+' --nth 8
```

<Warning>
Regular expression delimiters are slower than plain string delimiters. Use plain strings when possible for better performance.
</Warning>

### Transform display with --with-nth

Show only specific fields in the list:

```bash
# Show only filename and line content, hide line numbers
rg --line-number . | fzf --delimiter : --with-nth 1,3..
```

## Query history

fzf can remember your search queries across sessions:

```bash
fzf --history ~/.fzf_history
```

Use CTRL-N and CTRL-P to navigate through previous queries.

## Interactive query tips

<Steps>

### Start broad, then narrow

Begin with a fuzzy search to see many results, then add exact-match tokens to narrow down.

### Use prefix matching for structured data

When searching structured data like logs or CSV files, use `^` to match specific columns.

### Combine fuzzy and exact matching

Mix fuzzy terms for flexibility with exact terms for precision:

```bash
sbtrkt 'exact phrase' !exclude
```

### Use OR for alternatives

When you're unsure of the exact term, use OR to match multiple possibilities:

```bash
error | fail | exception
```

</Steps>

## Example workflows

  ```bash
  fd . | fzf --query "^src/ .tsx$ | .ts$ component"
  ```

  ```bash
  docker ps -a | fzf --query "!exited running"
  ```

  ```bash
  git log --oneline | fzf --query "^fix: | ^feat: !wip"
  ```
